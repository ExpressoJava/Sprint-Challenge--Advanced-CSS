1. Adaptive website is made for specific layouts like desktop, tablet, and mobile and responsive website is more flexible and fluid
 and can be viewed optimally on variety screen sizes and can work with any screen  size if designed correctly. 

 2. Mobile first means the design of mobile version of the website is at the heart of the design and take into account
    the constraints and user browsing behavior on mobile devices. Desktop first is to start design for desktop view and uses
    max-width queries for smaller and smaller screen width. 

3. It makes calculating  the pixel  sisez of each Rem easier. When we're using font-size: 62.5%, 1rem = 10px. 

4. It allows us to style CSS more effectively and efficiently and it allows us to generate CSS styling
     from preprocessor's syntax and have other features that normal CSS does not have. Basically it's a compiler that interpreted
     and  translated into CSS for browser to render. 

5. mixins is probably my favorite because you can reuse the styles as many times as i wish. Nesting is probably the one that gives me the most trouble.
